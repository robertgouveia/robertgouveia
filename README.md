# Hi, I'm Robert! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a full stack developer...

Based in UK. I like programming at Cafe's and have quite the addiction to the gym life!

Programming is not just a hobby but a lifestyle, I am thinking of starting a channel on youtube documenting my early days and hopefully this results in episodes leading up to some more advanced projects and products.
